I'm a graduate student from [School of Medicne](https://szmed.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes bioinformatic, machine learning, computational biology and cancer genomics.

I am very fortune to be advised by [Dr. Mini Huang](https://github.com/Huanglab-ai) from [School of Medicne](https://szmed.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/).

You can find my cv here: [Qijie He's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

I will share and document related code on [my homepage](https://github.com/Nadine-sudo).
